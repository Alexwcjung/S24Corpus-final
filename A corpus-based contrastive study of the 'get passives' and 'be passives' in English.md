# A corpus-based contrastive study of the 'get passives' and 'be passives' in English
written by Woochang Jung

### 1. Introduction
A solid Understanding of English grammar helps learners use English more accurately as a second language (L2). One common challenge for learners of English as a foreign language (EFL) is mastering the passive voice. Learners from different first language (L1) backgrounds often find English passives difficult (Loan, 2019). Those whose L1 does not have the passive voice struggle more with English passives (Cowan, 2008). Even learners whose L1 includes some passive forms face challenges. For example, L1-Thai speakers, whose language mainly uses passives in a negative way, often make mistakes with English passive constructions (Simargool, 2008). In addition to the 'be-passive' (be + past participle), the 'get-passive' (get + past participle) is also widely used in spoken English (Leech, Hundt, Mair, & Smith, 2009). Many studies based on language corpora highlight the prevalence of get-passives in various English dialects (e.g., Carter & McCarthy, 1999; Mair, 2006). Granger (1983) compared the use of 'get-passives' between British and American English, noting that they are less common in British English, while 'be-passives' are more frequent than 'get-passives' in both dialects. Additionally, Weiner and Labov (1983) found that the use of 'get-passives' is increasing among American English speakers. This article examines the distribution of the English 'get-passive' compared to the 'be-passive.' A corpus study is used to find out the frequency of 'get-passive' and 'be-passive' in written and spoken texts. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for teaching English passives in the EFL context. The research questions is as follows: What is the frequency of 'be + past participle' and 'get + past participle' constructions in spoken versus written English texts?

### 2. Literature Review

#### 2.1 Characteristics of Get-Passives

##### 2.1.1 Absence of an Agent By-Phrase
'Get-passives' often lack an agent. Studies confirm that get-passives typically "do not include an expressed animate agent" (Quirk et al., 1985, p. 161). In Collins' (1996) research, 92% of get-passives did not have an agent as shown in example (1): (1) Henry got beaten last night.

##### 2.1.2 Dynamic Lexical Verb
Get-passives are exclusively used with dynamic verbs, which indicate actions rather than outcomes (Huddleston & Pullum, 2002, p. 1442). Alexiadou (2005) states that "the get-passive is not used with stative verbs or verbs where the subject cannot be seen as affected." For instance, "be" cannot be replaced by "get" in sentences like example (2) (Huddleston & Pullum, 2002, p. 1442):
(2) It was/*got believed that the letter was a forgery.

##### 2.1.3 Responsibility of the Subject
Subjects in get-passives often have some responsibility for initiating the event. Huddleston (1984) points out that "get" suggests that the subject has some degree of initiative, unlike "be." For example, in (3) (GivÃ³n & Yang, 1994, p. 120), the subject of the get-passive bears some responsibility:
(3) He got caught by the police.
    He was caught by the police.

##### 2.1.4 Semantic Implication
Hatcher (1949) noted that central get-passives are used for events with either positive or negative outcomes. Fleisher (2006) added that these events usually have significant effects, either good or bad, on the subject. Most of the time, get-passives indicate negative events (Carter & McCarthy, 1999). For instance, phrases like "get arrested," "get beaten," "get criticized," and "get penalized" generally refer to adverse situations (Hatcher, 1949; Budwig, 1990). Collins (1996) discovered that 67% of get-passives have negative meanings, and Leech et al. (2009) observed that the use of negative get-passives increased from 60.3% to 66.3% between the 1960s and 1990s.

Research shows that central get-passives often carry emotional or interpersonal implications, indicating the speakerâ€™s feelings or the subject's condition, unlike the neutral be-passives (Stubbs, 2001; Fryd, 2008). Thus, be- and get-passives are not used interchangeably (Siewierska, 1984; Guerrero Medina, 2009). Biber et al. (1999) found that get-passives usually involve verbs with negative connotations, referring to actions that are tough or disadvantageous for the subject. RÃ¼hlemann (2007) highlighted that central get-passives favor verbs with a negative core meaning.

### 3. Data Collection Methodology

#### 3.1 Spoken Data Collection

**Data Source**
The spoken data were collected from TED, specifically focusing on the 100 most viewed video clips within the communication section. TED videos are selected for their high engagement and diverse range of topics, providing a rich source for linguistic analysis (TED, n.d.).

**Selection Criteria**
- **Popularity**: Videos were selected based on view count to ensure that only the most popular presentations were included.
- **Category**: Only videos categorized under the "communication" section were considered to maintain thematic coherence.
- **Speaker Criteria**: Only videos featuring native-like or native speakers of English were included to ensure linguistic consistency and relevance.

**Data Cleaning**
- **Transcription**: The audio content of each video was transcribed using automated transcription tools, followed by manual verification to ensure accuracy.
- **Timestamp Removal**: All timestamps were removed from the transcripts to maintain a continuous flow of text.
- **Exclusion of Non-verbal Elements**: Elements such as laughter, applause, and other non-verbal cues were excluded to focus solely on the spoken language.
- **Consistency Check**: The final transcripts were reviewed for formatting consistency and to confirm the removal of non-verbal elements.

#### 3.2 Written Data Collection

**Data Source**
Written data were extracted from the News on the Web (NOW) corpus, a comprehensive linguistic resource comprising a vast collection of online news articles. This corpus is designed to support research in linguistics and language variation (Davies, 2013).

**Content and Scope**
The NOW corpus includes millions of words from web-based news articles across a broad spectrum of news websites, ensuring a diverse representation of contemporary online language use.

**Sample Selection and Cleaning**
- For this study, samples from the NOW corpus collected between 2010 and 2016 were used. The sample data consists of 2,916 texts, totaling approximately 1.7 million words.
- **Downloading and Preprocessing**: The samples were downloaded from the NOW corpus. Python scripts were utilized to remove characters such as HTML tags (`<p>`, `<h>`), and to split the text IDs. This preprocessing step ensured that the data was clean and ready for analysis.

#### 3.3 Rationale for Comparison

The reason for comparing TED talks from the communication section and the NOW corpus is to ensure the authenticity and level of language proficiency in both spoken and written data. This comparison is crucial for achieving the research objective: to find out the frequency of 'be passives' and 'get passives' between spoken and written texts. By selecting sources that are comparable in terms of language use and authenticity, the study ensures that the analysis of passive constructions is legitimate and reflective of contemporary usage in both modes of communication.

#### 3.4 Combined Data Set

The combined dataset for this research includes:
- **Spoken Data**: Cleaned transcripts from 100 TED video clips featuring native-like or native speakers of English, ensuring high-quality spoken language data.
- **Written Data**: Samples from the NOW corpus collected between 2010 and 2016, comprising 2,916 texts with 1.7 million words, representing a wide array of online news articles.

This carefully selected dataset offers a strong base for analyzing language use in both spoken and written forms.

### Chi-Squared Test 
In this study, we employed the Chi-Squared test to examine the differences in the frequency of 'be + past participle' and 'get + past participle' constructions between spoken and written English texts. The Chi-Squared test is a statistical method used to determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables. The primary goal of using the Chi-Squared test in this research was to test the null hypothesis, which posited that there is no difference in the usage of passive constructions ('be + past participle' and 'get + past participle') between spoken and written texts. Rejecting this null hypothesis would suggest that the differences observed are statistically significant and not due to random chance.

#### Methodology

1. **Formulate Hypotheses**:
   - **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: There is no difference in the usage of 'be + past participle' and 'get + past participle' constructions between spoken and written texts.
   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: There is a significant difference in the usage of 'be + past participle' and 'get + past participle' constructions between spoken and written texts.

2. **Data Collection**:
   - The study collected data on the frequency of 'be + past participle' and 'get + past participle' constructions from a representative sample of spoken and written texts.

3. **Calculate Expected Frequencies**:
   - Based on the assumption that there is no difference (null hypothesis), expected frequencies for each category (spoken and written texts) were calculated.

4. **Degrees of Freedom**:
   - The degrees of freedom (df) for this test is calculated as the number of categories minus one. In this study, with two categories (spoken and written texts), the degrees of freedom is 1.

5. **Determine Significance**:
   - The Chi-Squared test yielded a statistic of 359.143 with a p-value of 4.327e-80.

#### Interpretation of Results
![Chi-Squared Test Results](https://github.com/Alexwcjung/S24Corpus-final/blob/main/Corpus/Chi-Squared%20Test%20Results.png)

|                          | Spoken Texts | Written Texts | Total  |
|--------------------------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| **Observed Frequencies** |              |               |        |
| be + past participle     | 1794         | 13910         | 15704  |
| get + past participle    | 128          | 124           | 252    |
| **Total**                | 1922         | 14034         | 16056  |
| **Expected Frequencies** |              |               |        |
| be + past participle     | 1879.27      | 13824.73      | 15704  |
| get + past participle    | 30.15        | 221.85        | 252    |

Given the Chi-Squared statistic of 359.143 and the p-value of 4.327e-80, indicating a highly significant result, we reject the null hypothesis. This result indicates a significant difference in the usage of passive constructions between spoken and written texts. Specifically, it supports the conclusion that 'be + past participle' is much more common in both forms, whereas 'get + past participle' is more frequent in spoken texts compared to written texts, although it remains less common overall.

## 5. Conclusion and future research
The analysis shows that the use of passive constructions ('be + past participle' and 'get + past participle') is significantly different between spoken and written texts. Specifically, 'be + past participle' is much more common in both spoken and written forms. However, 'get + past participle' is found more often in spoken texts than in written texts, though it is still less common overall. These findings indicate that while both forms of passive constructions are used in English, their usage depends on the context, highlighting differences between spoken and written communication. The higher frequency of 'get + past participle' in spoken texts may be due to its more conversational nature, while 'be + past participle' remains the standard in written texts. This insight is useful for linguistic studies, helping us understand how language varies in different communication modes.
